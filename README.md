# HireLog
HireLog is a pet project designed for convenient tracking of the job search process. With this application, you can:

- Keep track of your job applications.
- Analyze the statistics of recruiter responses (and lack of responses).
- Monitor the status of your applications (submitted, reviewed, interview invitation, rejection, etc.).
- Improve your job search strategy based on the collected data.
